I am a senior double majoring in Data Science and Economics at New York University Shanghai. Currently, I am a data management volunteer at the World Food Program (WFP) of the UN, a business analytics intern at Craft Associates, and an algorithmic fairness researcher.

Before entering the discipline, I have always been fascinated by the power of big data and the way it recommends perfect songs or talks to humans like a real person. On my journey of studying data science, a pivotal moment came when I worked as a research analyst intern at the Shanghai General Hospital. I witnessed a gaping void that could swallow hundreds of thousands of real human’s access to in-person care, health privacy, and even the right to choose their own treatment plans. This experience guided me to Abu Dhabi and New York, where I continued my search for data-driven solutions to data-imposed questions (more details in Resume and Research!). I have worked on research topics in sports analytics, hardware security, and large language models (NLP). 

Outside of academics, I enjoy athletic training, reading and writing, listening to and producing music, traveling…
