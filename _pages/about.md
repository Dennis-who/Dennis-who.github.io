### Student at Harvard University

I am a first-year Master’s student of the Data Science program at Harvard University. Before that, I graduated from University of Rochester double majoring in Data Science and Financial Economics. 

### Why Data Science

I always have a strong belief in the ability of data to help us understand social problems, in order to ultimately contribute to the public wellbeing. This led me to be a research data analyst at University of Rochester Medical Center for almost two years where I utilized data science techniques to keep tracking people’s opinions on e-cigarettes and understand people’s mental health concerns under the pandemic using social media data. Drawn by the unprecedented power of objective tools to analyze real-world complex subjective questions, I grew determined to become a data scientist.
