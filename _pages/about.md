Hi there! I am a first-year M.S. student studying data science at New York University. I have worked as data science interns in conculting and healthcare, and worked on research topics in large language models, recommendation systems, sports analytics, and hardware security. Currently, I am working as graduate assistant at the Academic Analytics department at NYU and seeking DS/ MLE summer opportunities for 2024. 

I graduated in May 2023 from NYU Shanghai with a double major in data science and economics. Learn about my journey there with this [article](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/stories/dennis-hu-shiyi-23-following-his-heart)!

Outside of academics, I enjoy athletic training, reading and writing, listening to and producing music, travelingâ€¦
