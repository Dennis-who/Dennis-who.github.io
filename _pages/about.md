Hi there! I am a senior double majoring in Data Science and Economics at New York University Shanghai. I have worked on research topics in sports analytics, hardware security, and large language models (NLP).

Outside of academics, I enjoy athletic training, reading and writing, listening to and producing music, travelingâ€¦
