###   Academic Writing and Speaking Tutoring
Although I am a Data Science student, I also love to engage in non-technical reading and writing! I was nominated in my thrid semester of study by Professor Amy Goldman of the Global Writing Program to start work as a writing and speaking tutor. I especially enjoy the practicums every week on various writing topics, including poems, epics, science fiction, op-eds, etc. Now, helping other undergraduate students engage in multimodal texts is an indispensable part of my daily routine.

### Resident Assistant (RA)
I am currently working as a Resident Assistant in the Jinqiao Residence hall. My main responsibility in this role is to develop a safe and inclusive community for a floor of 40 students, as well as implement programming to support community development. I also assess and respond to crisis situations, wellness concerns, and facilities emergencies. All my residents are freshmen, and I am grateful to have this opportunity to foster a living and learning community that values academic and personal growth! 


### International Youth Neuroscience Association at NYUSH
I was the head of events committee when we planned for the Brain Awareness Week 2020. It was a week-long themed event culminating in a paper contest and presentation on topics in neuroscience. For the event to go smoothly, I reached out to professors at Tongji University to be judges and panelists on the last day. In the end, more than 300 contestants turned out to the event, which was almost double the number from last year.


### UnCoVer
At the start of the pandemic in 2020, many societal issues have bubbled to public vision because of exacerbation from the virus. Together with 5 other students, I started a WeChat official account called UnCoVer, intended as a pun to both the name of the virus and our visions for the account. We went out and interviewed delivery people working under harsh conditions, blind masseuses who never got a massage themselves; we also translated original poems and op-eds both in English and Chinese for the larger audience to see. We worked purely out of volunteerism, and we could not afford ads to grow our platform. However, this is still among activities that I'm most proud of through my three and a half years in college.


### SHKP Charity Run and Shanghai Marathon
I firmly believe in the power of sports to change lives and contribute to social good. Except for 2020 when both events were cancelled due to COVID-19, I volunteer every year since entering college to distribute medals, deliver food and medicine, and schedule events. In 2019, I entered as a contestant in the SHKP vertical run and finished fourth.
