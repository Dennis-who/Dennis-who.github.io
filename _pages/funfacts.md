## Music Production

I taught myself how to make beats after I finished Gaokao. Originally I only made simple sample loops on FL Studio, after which I slowly progressed to Ableton Live. I have always been drawn to Frank Ocean's (who also happens to be my favorite musician) simplistic yet maximally detailed style of production. When I studied away at Abu Dhabi, I was fortunate to take Professor Matteo Marciano's production course, after which I produced a full PB R&B song (with vocals by Jiire Smith).

*This song is titled Undercurrent*

Curious how it sounds? <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hk-Bayrn9fpV_3f8-9fRdmyzpGeCVywX/view?usp=sharing">here</a> is a link to the mp3 file.

## Athletic Training

Coming into university with zero previous fitness experience, I trained through several different programming styles: bodybuilding, powerlifting, olympic weightlifting, Crossfit, and most recently sports performance training. I get immense joy from gaining new knowledge in this field and putting it into practice: I am now the strength and conditioning coach assistant, helping players on NYUSH's basketball team prevent injuries and rehabilitate if they have existing conditions. I am also studying to get NSCA certified!

## Polydactyly

I was born with a condition called [Polydactyly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyly), which means I had an abnormal number of fingers. In my case, I had an extra thumb in my dominant right hand. I underwent 3 surgeries to deal with the condition, but fortunately now I can go about most normal activities with no problem!
