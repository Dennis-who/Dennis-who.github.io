I am a curious person and willing to spend time studying new things! Here are some fun facts about me. 

## 1. Study American Sign Language

Knowing Rochester is home to one of the largest Deaf populations and our school offered American Sign Language (ASL) courses, I studied it for two years. I appreciated the opportunities to learn the beauty of ASL, attend Deaf community events, make friends with them, and learn their culture. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTCA6u65JKQ">Sharing a story told in ASL ^.^</a>

## 2. Light Designer & Producer of a theater group
I have a great appreciation of theater arts, and in college, I enjoyed productions performed by our university theater groups. However, I found that even with several independent theater groups, all of them primarily produced works of North American theater. I aimed to diversify the theater community on campus by introducing a Chinese aesthetic, and to do so, I founded a group along with several others to introduce Chinese theater and culture to more people. 
 
As the light designer for two productions, I self-learned light designing, lighting equipments and procedures. As the producer, I led  a group of 45 students, oversaw and orchestrated four productions with donation increases 10% every semester. I also collaborated with students from other theater groups to organize workshops on theater group management and insights from different productions.
