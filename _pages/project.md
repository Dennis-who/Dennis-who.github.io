Besides the projects in the Publication section, here are some more projects that I have conducted.  

## 1. [Automatic Differentiation Python Library](https://github.com/cs107-swiftdiff/cs107-FinalProject)

This is a project building software that performs automatic differentiation (AD) for the user. The AD software, SwiftDiff, sequentially evaluates elementary functions, and avoids the complexity of symbolic differentiation and precision issues of numerical differentiation. The system implements multiple methods of AD that compute the derivatives of a function in a single flow with machine precision and accuracy.

## 2. <a href="https://edav.info">edav.info</a>

I am currently building `edav.info`, which is an additional resource for GR5293 Statistical Graphics and GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization courses offered at Columbia University. The website introduces R graphing techniques and is updated at a weekly basis.

## 3. [Recommender System](/files/rs.pdf) 

We created a recommender system using Amazon review dataset. We applied both content-based and collaborative filtering and reported the results.
