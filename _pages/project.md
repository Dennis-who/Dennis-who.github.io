Besides the projects in the Publications section, here are some more projects that I have conducted.  

## 1. [Automatic Differentiation Python Library](https://github.com/cs107-swiftdiff/cs107-FinalProject)

We built a software performing automatic differentiation (AD) for the user. The AD software, SwiftDiff, sequentially evaluates elementary functions, and avoids the complexity of symbolic differentiation and precision issues of numerical differentiation. The system implements multiple methods of AD that compute the derivatives of a function in a single flow with machine precision and accuracy.

## 2. [Mortality Prediction and Interpretation](/files/Mortality.pdf)

We used National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) dataset to predict a person's risk of dying. PCA was applied to deal with multicollinearity and reduce runtime and complexity for the later training. We performed KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Neural Network on data, and determined Random Forest to be the best model based on F1 score (0.803) and AUC (0.861). Feature importance was interpreted using SHAP value.

## 3. [Does money buy happiness? What affects world happiness?](/files/STAT139_Final.pdf) 

We performed several ordinary least squares models(OLS) and then mixed effect models to explore the relationship between happiness score and and other economic factors, social factors and etc collected by World happiness Report. We discovered that higher GDP values are positively correlated with higher happiness. Many other cultural, and social factors also have significant influence on happiness, such as percentage of people who have social support and the extent of satisfaction with the freedom to choose the lifestyle. Developed countries usually have positive relation between happiness score and health life expectancy, but some derdeveloping countries have negative relation between the two variables.
