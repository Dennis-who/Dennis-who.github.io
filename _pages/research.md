## Factual Generalization Capabilities of GPT-3 Across Domains [[paper]](/files/MLLU_final.pdf)

GPT-3 has achieved impressive results in general purpose question answering tasks, exceeding human performance in some instances, but still has its weaknesses. TruthfulQA looks at imitative falsehoods stemming from defections in the training dataset, and provides a benchmark of questions where the most common answer online will likely be false. Building on this, we present a further study on generalizing factuality across domains where such falsehoods are prone. We evaluate the effectiveness of different domain combinations and prompting techniques after cross-prompting among six domains. Further exploration of the general-ization capacities beyond questions present in TruthfulQA is then provided.

## NBA Winning Rate and Season Record Prediction [[paper]](/files/ML_Final_paper.pdf)

Statistics driven performance analysis has been gaining ground in all major sports leagues. Particularly, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is at the frontlines of transitioning to data-driven approaches. While various statistical models for predicting the MVP candidate and the championship possibilities have been developed, the field of single-game winning rate prediction has gone rather under-explored. Here we report our efforts in achieving accuracies of predicting single-game outcomes comparable to preexisting machine learning models. After formatting the raw dataset with aggregate functions that yield recent performance, we evaluated across five different models to generate our best guess at the W/L result. Since our model takes into account the lineups of each team, it also offers quantitative insights into NBA teamâ€™s roster management.

## [Does money buy happiness? What affects world happiness?](/files/STAT139_Final.pdf) 

We performed several ordinary least squares models(OLS) and then mixed effect models to explore the relationship between happiness score and and other economic factors, social factors and etc collected by World happiness Report. We discovered that higher GDP values are positively correlated with higher happiness. Many other cultural, and social factors also have significant influence on happiness, such as percentage of people who have social support and the extent of satisfaction with the freedom to choose the lifestyle. Developed countries usually have positive relation between happiness score and health life expectancy, but some derdeveloping countries have negative relation between the two variables. 

## 4. [Ethical Analysis of Boston 311 Service: Observational Study](https://sunli-lisun.github.io/ac221/)

Like many cities in the U.S., Boston offers a 311 line to connect citizens with non-emergency city services. This study combined the 311 service request datasets with demographic data, such as income, education level, poverty rate, race distribution, poverty rate, to answer the question: Does Boston provide 311 services fairly and equally to all citizens? As a result, while we found it unlikely that there is any explicit bias in Boston's 311 service provision (e.g. intentional prioritization of well-off neighborhoods or witholding of services from needy ones), we found discrepancies along demographic lines in the way the service is used, making it likely that neighborhoods do not receive equal treatment from city government through 311. Additionally, our analysis suggested that whiter and more well-off neighborhoods have a stronger preference for using the Citizen Connect App compared to their less well-off counterparts, which increased the likelihood that their cases are solved quickly and successfully. These factors, taken together, provided strong evidence for the existence of conditions leading to unequal outcomes along demographic lines, and a logical explanation for how it might occur.
